## What does it do?

Quimby creates self-destructing secret messages for you to share with your colleagues. Using Vault's response wrapping, Quimby stores your secret in Vault's [cubbyhole](https://www.vaultproject.io/docs/secrets/cubbyhole/index.html) and wraps it with a one-time-use token that expires one hour after creation.

After creating your secret message, Quimby gives you a URL to share with your colleague. The URL will show the secret message one time only. After accessing the secret, or after one hour, the secret is destroyed.

## Docker

It's easiest to run Quimby with Docker. Simply run the container like this:

    $ docker run \
      -e "VAULT_ADDR=$VAULT_ADDR" \
      -e "VAULT_TOKEN=$VAULT_TOKEN" \
      -p 3000:3000 \
      brianknight10/quimby

The Quimby image is stored in the [Docker Hub repository](https://hub.docker.com/r/brianknight10/quimby/)
